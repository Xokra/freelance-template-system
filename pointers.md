Pointers for Easy JS/Other Application (as requested):
For Awwwards-level quality, some effects are hard or impossible with pure CSS. Given your "learning JS" skill level and desire for easy implementation:

Lightweight GSAP/Anime.js for Complex Animations:

Reason: For truly fluid, timeline-based, and performant animations (e.g., staggered fades, complex path animations on SVG, synchronized movement of multiple elements), vanilla CSS becomes very cumbersome. GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) or Anime.js are highly optimized, easy to learn for basic animations, and specifically designed for this.

Implementation: Include the library (CDN or local). Instead of transition or keyframes for a complex sequence, you'd write a few lines of JS like gsap.to(".my-element", { x: 100, opacity: 0, duration: 1, stagger: 0.1 });

Focus: Use for hero section reveals, element entry animations on scroll (beyond simple fade-in/slide-up), or unique button click feedback.

Benefit: Allows for will-change to be managed automatically, often yields smoother results than raw CSS for complex scenarios.

LottieFiles for Vector Animations:

Reason: If you need elaborate, lightweight, resolution-independent animations (e.g., animated icons, loading spinners, abstract background elements), Lottie (exported from After Effects/Figma via a plugin) is ideal. It's a JSON-based animation format rendered by a small JS library.

Implementation: Design or find a Lottie animation, include the Lottie player JS, and embed the JSON.

Benefit: Incredible visual complexity with minimal file size and excellent performance.

Simple Parallax (CSS + Minimal JS):

Reason: While complex parallax often needs robust JS, subtle background parallax can be achieved with background-attachment: fixed; and clever CSS positioning, often enhanced by a few lines of JS to adjust background-position based on scroll (simpler than full 3D transforms).

Implementation: CSS for background-attachment, and a small JS function to update a CSS variable for background-position-y based on window.scrollY.
