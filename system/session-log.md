üîó INTEGRATION_TESTED: All 6 components implemented with 4 palette variants. Semantic variables and body class switching confirmed. Neumorphic effects visually distinct. Accessibility enhancements included.
üéØ BUSINESS_IMPACT: Successfully completed the CSS framework for the Standard Tier (Neumorphism), expanding the sales toolkit with a modern, interactive UI option (Rp 2.5M - Rp 5M). This offers a clear quality difference from the Budget tier and provides another high-value option for modern portfolios and app showcases.
üìã NEXT_RECOMMENDED: Continue CSS framework development to complete the Budget Tier. Focus on the Organic style to provide another distinct good-value offering within the Budget tier.
