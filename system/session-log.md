### 📅 2025-07-26 - 00:14 AM WIB Session Log

**Session Overview:** This session was dedicated to significantly enhancing the `minimalist.css` framework by implementing a "smarter" semantic color mapping system and integrating a robust CSS reset. This completes a major step in making the Budget Tier framework highly flexible and maintainable.

📁 BUILT_THIS_SESSION: - [2025-07-26 00:14 WIB] ~/freelance-system/templates/css/frameworks/minimalist.css (Updated with semantic color mapping and reset)
🔗 INTEGRATION_TESTED:

    - Minimalist CSS: Semantic palette switching confirmed in test environment.

    - System Config: Keymaps and directory structure were confirmed functional during session activities.

🎯 BUSINESS_IMPACT: - **Enhanced Minimalist Framework:** Significantly improves reusability and theming flexibility for the Budget Tier, making it faster to create new minimalist sites. - **Foundational Strength:** Solidifies the core CSS methodology for future framework development.
📋 NEXT_RECOMMENDED:
Phase 1 - Foundation & Credibility: 1. Create `luxury.css` (premium tier CSS framework - $1500-2500 anchor). 2. Create `glassmorphism.css` (standard tier CSS framework - $800-1200). 3. Begin HTML template development using the completed CSS frameworks, starting with `minimalist.css`.
📝 NOTES: - Minimalist framework now uses semantic color variables (e.g., `--fl-bg-primary`) for easier palette switching via single class on `<body>`. - Added a basic CSS reset for improved cross-browser consistency. - Neovim keymaps (`keymaps.lua`) and `README.md` were reviewed and finalized as part of system setup during this session. - The `~/freelance-system/` directory structure and core system files (`quality-check.md`, `session-log.md`) were set up/confirmed on 2025-07-25 around 17:00 WIB.
