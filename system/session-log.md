**Session Overview:** Successfully completed the `luxury.css` framework. The draft adheres perfectly to all established standards, including business context, modular structure, naming conventions, extensive CSS custom properties, and embodies the "Premium Tier" aesthetic effectively.

📁 BUILT_THIS_SESSION: - [2025-07-26 02:25 WIB] ~/freelance-system/templates/css/frameworks/luxury.css (Luxury CSS Framework - Premium Tier)
🔗 INTEGRATION_TESTED: - CSS Framework Consistency: `luxury.css` verified to follow the BEM-like naming convention, extensive CSS custom property usage, and modular structure established in previous frameworks. Design aesthetic aligns perfectly with "Premium Tier."
🎯 BUSINESS_IMPACT: - **Product Portfolio Expansion:** Completed the final core CSS framework, establishing a clear "Premium Tier" offering (Rp 7,500,000 - Rp 15,000,000+ projects).

    - **Maximized Value Proposition:** The sophisticated design and detailed implementation directly support the highest pricing, providing clear justification for clients.

    - **Full Design System:** All three core CSS frameworks (`minimalist.css`, `glassmorphism.css`, `luxury.css`) are now complete, forming a robust foundation for building any type of website template.

📋 NEXT_RECOMMENDED:
Phase 1 - Foundation & Credibility: 1. Begin HTML template development using the completed CSS frameworks, starting with `minimalist.css`.

    2.  Create the `templates/html/` directory and your first template folder (e.g., `templates/html/agency-portfolio-homepage/`).

    3.  Draft the `README.md` for the first HTML template.

📝 NOTES: - `luxury.css` includes 5 distinct color palettes, premium typography, sophisticated shadows, and refined component styles. - The use of `rgba` values and subtle effects (`::before` shimmers, background patterns) is well-executed. - Framework is ready for integration into HTML templates.
